# The Definitive Guide to GTFS

*Consuming open public transportation data with the General Transit Feed
Specification*

Originally written by Quentin Zervaas.

## About This Book

This book is a comprehensive guide to GTFS -- the General Transit Feed
Specification. It is comprised of two main sections.

The first section describes what GTFS is and provides details about the
specification itself. In addition to this it also provides various
discussion points and things to consider for each of the files in the
specification.

The second section covers a number of topics that relate to actually
using GTFS feeds, such as how to calculate fares, how to search for
trips, how to optimize feed data and more.

This book is written for developers that are using transit data for web
sites, mobile applications and more. It aims to be as language-agnostic
as possible, but uses SQL to demonstrate concepts of extracting data
from a GTFS feed.
