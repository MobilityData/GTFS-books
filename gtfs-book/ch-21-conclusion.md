## Conclusion

Thanks for reading *The Definitive Guide to GTFS*. While there are many
techniques that may take some time to comprehend in this book, the
content should bring you up to speed with GTFS quickly.

At first glance, GTFS appears to be very simple, but there are a number
of "gotchas" which are not immediately apparent until you have spent
significant time working with a range of feeds.

The key takeaways from this book are:

* How GTFS feeds are structured
* How to import a GTFS feed to SQL and perform queries
* How to search for trips, handle blocks and calculate fares
* How to optimize an SQL database to minimize resource usage on mobile
  devices.
